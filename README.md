# Chat App

Chat App is a simple voice chat I decided to make to replace discord for me and my frieds.

It is a very simple chat app where you can create rooms and join them with a name of your choosing and a color.

## Installation

-   To start all you need is a package manager like npm, yarn, or pnpm.

-   And then you clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UmutSen2662/chat-app.git
cd chat-app
```

-   After that you can use your package managers install command to finish setting up:

```bash
npm install
```

## Development

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at http://localhost:5173 by default.

## Build

To create a production-ready build, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

The build output will be located in the docs directory because I am currently serving it using github pages.
